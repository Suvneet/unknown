# HTMLSelenium
HTML STB Client automation using selenium
We created this framework to automate HTML Client running over STB.
First we created the framework to automate this client running over Chrome browser.
Then we integrated QTWebdriver libraries on STB and same test cases can be run over HTML client running over STB's QT Browser.
